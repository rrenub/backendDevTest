# Backend dev technical test
We want to offer a new feature to our customers showing similar products to the one they are currently seeing. To do this we agreed with our front-end applications to create a new REST API operation that will provide them the product detail of the similar products for a given one. [Here](./similarProducts.yaml) is the contract we agreed.

We already have an endpoint that provides the product Ids similar for a given one. We also have another endpoint that returns the product detail by product Id. [Here](./existingApis.yaml) is the documentation of the existing APIs.

**Create a Spring boot application that exposes the agreed REST API on port 5000.**

# Solution

The solution for this test is in `myApp` folder. It will start a Spring application on port 5000.
